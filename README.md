Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- [Nest (NestJS)](https://docs.nestjs.com/) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
- In addition to [React native framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native combines the best parts of native development with React. You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app from scratch.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. It was used as the db of this application.
